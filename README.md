    Note that for now Neural Network can play only as O.<br>
    The Neural Network's config file nn_conf.txt should be present in the same directory.<br>
    Pass 9 numbers representing XO board to stdin, where -1 is O, 1 is X and 0 is empty field.<br>
    Output is index to place O into.<br>

<h2>100% Generated config file!</h2>
<p>
    Inside root folder you can find 100_config.txt, which contains 100% accuracy output for AI.<br>
    You can also reach 100% accuracy, but training will take about an hour or less.<br>
